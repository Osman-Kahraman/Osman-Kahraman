## Osman KAHRAMAN

  <p>
👋 Hi!

I am a highly motivated software developer with 5 years of advanced Python experience, along with a strong background in machine learning and TensorFlow. 
I have developed production-level solutions such as the ALi real estate tracker and built a solid technical foundation through hands-on engineering experience. 
Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Programming at Seneca Polytechnic, I also serve as a Team Lead at Google Developer Group (GDG). I am quick to adapt, 
enjoy solving complex problems, and seek opportunities to apply my technical and leadership skills in innovative and growth-oriented environments.

📫 Feel free to connect with me at LinkedIn or explore my work here on GitHub.
  </p>
